# LootToChat

This is a simple WoW Classic addon that automatically announces the loot of the
current mob to your raid if you are the master looter. It is intended to be used
by master looters who quickly want to loot all items to themselves while the
raid moves, but want to make sure everyone is aware of which items have dropped.

The loot quality threshold can be adjusted since you might not always, for
example, want to announce rare (blue) loot.

Commands:
```
/ltc - Shows the help message and the current loot quality threshold
/ltc on - Turns the addon on (default)
/ltc off - Turns the addon temporarily off
/ltc set <n> - Sets the loot quality threshold to n (3 for rares, 4 for epics, etc.)
```
